# Responsive-Social-Media-Analytics-Software
Social Platform Native API Integration
Connect to API for Instagram, YouTube, Tik Tok to get analytics for each user in real time as the platforms report performance. Build a account linking page to allow them to link their accounts to these APIs with authentication and safety of user data.

Video Upload for Transcription and Scoring
Set up webhook for when videos are posted on the platforms. Once posted the platform will send the video to OpenAI for transcription, and the content will be analyzed for feedback and scoring.
This process is independent of analytics since the API for the platforms doesn’t handle video transcription or scoring—it only manages social media data analytics.

Correct Workflow for the MVP:
User Links Social Accounts (via API):
Users link their TikTok, Instagram, or YouTube accounts via API to fetch engagement data (views, likes, clicks) from their social media posts.

Video Upload (Separate Process):
Users upload their video directly to the MVP platform. This can be an original video or one they’ve posted on social media.
The platform will send the video to OpenAI to be transcribed, and the content will be scored based on engagement quality, clarity, or other metrics.

Display Results:
The analytics (likes, views, etc.) and the AI-generated content feedback (transcription, score, suggestions) will be displayed on the dashboard for users to review.

To Summarise:
Native social platform API's fetch social media post analytics (not videos).
Users uploads videos to social media sites and web hooks allow us to use the platform for transcription and scoring and suggestions.
